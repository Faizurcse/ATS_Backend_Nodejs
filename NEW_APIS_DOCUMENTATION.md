    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "totalEntries": 5,
    "totalHours": 40.5,
    "totalBillableAmount": 2025.00,
    "averageHoursPerEntry": 8.1
  },
  "count": 5
}
```

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Get all submitted timesheets
const response = await fetch('/api/timesheet/approval?status=SUBMITTED');

// Get timesheets for a specific recruiter
const response = await fetch('/api/timesheet/approval?recruiterName=John');

// Get timesheets for a specific week
const response = await fetch('/api/timesheet/approval?weekStart=2024-01-15&weekEnd=2024-01-21');
```

## Frontend Integration

### 1. Attachment Upload Component
The recruiter timesheet component now includes:
- Attachment upload button (ðŸ“Ž) in the actions column
- Attachment upload dialog with name and path inputs
- Integration with the attachment upload API

### 2. Approval Data Component
The timesheet approval component now includes:
- Summary statistics card showing total entries, hours, billable amount, and average hours
- Enhanced approval workflow with bulk operations
- Real-time data updates after approval actions

## Database Schema

### TimesheetEntry Model
The existing `TimesheetEntry` model already includes all necessary fields:
- `attachments`: String field for storing attachment information
- `submittedAt`: DateTime field for submission timestamp
- `approvedAt`: DateTime field for approval timestamp
- `approvedBy`: String field for approver identification

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "Detailed error message"
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `404`: Not Found (timesheet entry not found)
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Testing

### Test Script
Use the provided test script to verify API functionality:
```bash
node test-new-apis.js
```

The test script covers:
1. Timesheet creation
2. Timesheet submission
3. Attachment upload
4. Approval data retrieval
5. Timesheet approval

## Security Considerations

1. **File Upload Security**: The current implementation stores file paths. In production, implement proper file upload with:
   - File type validation
   - File size limits
   - Secure file storage
   - Virus scanning

2. **Access Control**: Ensure proper authentication and authorization for:
   - Attachment uploads
   - Approval data access
   - Timesheet modifications

3. **Data Validation**: All inputs are validated on both frontend and backend

## Future Enhancements

1. **File Upload**: Implement actual file upload functionality with cloud storage
2. **Attachment Preview**: Add preview capabilities for uploaded files
3. **Bulk Attachment**: Allow multiple file uploads at once
4. **Attachment Categories**: Categorize attachments (receipts, reports, etc.)
5. **Approval Workflow**: Implement multi-level approval workflows
6. **Notifications**: Add email/SMS notifications for approval events
